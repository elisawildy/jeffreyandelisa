          <figcaption>On the first day of high school, you walked in to the first class <i> late</i>. That day, I figured you were just a guy that was "too cool for school". However, you have turned out to be quite opposite. You're one of the harest working, smartest people I know, which are some of the many reasons I love you so much. I didn't know it on that first day, but you would become a huge part of my life. I thought this picture captured my first impression of you very well. Also, I'm wearing one of my many Lady Gaga shirts, the exact one I wore on that first day of school. You still remember me in that shirt with some zebra shorts on. A lot has changed for both of us since that first day.</figcaption>

I can't remember which card game it was, but I do remember you took a million photos, then later used your skills to edit them.</figcaption>

To this day, I still regret that I did that. I just had never been asked to do something like that before. I can't believe I said no... I'm very sorry. Thanks for sticking with me, babe.</figcaption>
