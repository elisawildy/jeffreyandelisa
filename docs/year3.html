Whether we were walking Otto, or just needed some quiet and calming air, we would stroll or wander around the path in your neighborhood. It never mattered what the temperature was outside. Sometimes you had hidden candies in your Carhart jacket, some of which we shared under the stair at MNHS. Let's keep walking and keep making these special memories.</figcaption>

The piano always seems to be in a different place. However, that doesn't change the way you play. You have always been impressive, from Elton John, to George Winston, to Five for Fighting - all of which we have played/sang together. You know you like my signing ;). I hope you keep up this passion. I truly enjoy it. I just wish I could play as well as you do.</figcaption>

When you came to pick me up, it was in that nice red bug your mom owned with the top donw. It was a beautiful night for prom. I had tons of fun being able to see you on the dance floor. I know we had tons of fun at after-prom as well, watching the mind-reader and hypnotist. Thank you for taking me!</figcaption>
