That day, I figured you were just a guy that was "too cool for school". However, you have turned out to be quite opposite. You're one of the harest working, smartest people I know, which are some of the many reasons I love you so much. I didn't know it on that first day, but you would become a huge part of my life. I thought this picture captured my first impression of you very well. Also, I'm wearing one of my many Lady Gaga shirts, the exact one I wore on that first day of school. You still remember me in that shirt with some zebra shorts on. A lot has changed for both of us since that first day.</figcaption>

Since you were new to town, it wasn't so common to meet your friends. We tried to watch a movie and you were highly concerned that I wouldn't like it. We also played cards. I can't remember which card game it was, but I do remember you took a million photos, then later used your skills to edit them.</figcaption>
