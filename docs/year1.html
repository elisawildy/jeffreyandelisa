                        <figcaption class="col-sm-6 figure-caption">On the first day of high school, this guy walked in to the first class <i> late</i>. That day, I figured he was just a guy that was "too cool for school". However, he has turned out to be quite opposite. He's one of the harest working, smartest people I know, which are some of the many reasons I love him so much. I didn't know it on that first day, but this guy was going to become a huge part of my life. I though this picture captured my first impression of him well. Also, I'm wearing one of my many Lady Gaga shirts, the exact one I wore on that first day of school. Jeffrey still remembers me in that shirt with some zebra shorts on. A lot has changed since that first day.</figcaption>

Jeffrey was new to town, so meeting his friends wasn't a common thing. We tried to watch a movie and Jeffrey was highly concerned that I wouldn't like it. We also played cards. I can't remember which card game it was, but I do remember Jeffrey taking millions of pictures.</figcaption>
