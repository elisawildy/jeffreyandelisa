Sure, tomorrow, during my presentation, I would match the sun. Well, that afternoon, you left town, and I gave my presentation. Soon after, the security desk had emailed me saying I had a package. What do you know, Jeffrey sent me these beautiful sunflowers. They were my favorite things and I can't help but get the butterflies whenever I look back on it.
