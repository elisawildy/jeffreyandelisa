It's hard to use a GoPro unless your some kind of stunt devil or you're always travelling and doing cool things. Well, this wasn't us. Therefore, we decided to take the GoPro sledding with us. I remember there was a huge bump at the bottom of the hill. It hurt your butt so bad to land after that bump. I thought it was funny that you had the GoPro on his head, heading towards this bump, but you fell off the sled before you even got there. Wipeouts on the camera were pretty cool.

We would constantly go to Candiopolis at the mall and purchase jelly beans to eat as we walked around the mall. I don't recall buying much at the mall besides little snack. It was fun to guess the flavors. Anyway, I attached the balloons to the jar of jelly beans. I think you really liked this :). Thanks for so many great Valentine's Days.</figcaption>
