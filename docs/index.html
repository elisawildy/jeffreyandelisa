                Dear Jeffrey,<br><br>

                It's been six years. I know six isn't some crazy special number, but I thought it was time to put something like this together. Now, we can look back at each year and see all of the fun we have had, in hopes that we will have just as much, if not more, within the future. As I have been looking back, I've smiled at everything we have accomplished and discovered together. Not all of these memories can be captured by photos alone and I still continue to smile with those memories in mind. I really appreciate all that you do for me. I couldn't ask for anything more from you, so thank you. Thank you a million times. I hope I can keep thanking you as we continue to make memories. My life would be a lot more dull without you in it.<br><br>

                Love,<br>
                Elisa
